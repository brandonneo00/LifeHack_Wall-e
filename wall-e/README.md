## Inspiration
It is appalling to know that more than 50% of our food waste happens at the consumer and retail-and-distribution stage. Many of these food items are in fact edible and are thrown away for reasons such as them being ugly or due to the oversight of consumers not realizing that they are unable to finish the food products that they purchased on time. Furthermore, it is also common for many stall owners to be unable to finish selling their food products. Hence, many of these food items go to waste partially because there lacks a platform to connect those that have food items to donate and those who are in need of these food items. 

## What it does
Save Wast-e is a web application that adopts the concept of Instagram and Carousell but combines them into a single platform with the purpose of reducing food waste in Singapore. 

## How we built it
The frontend of our Web Application is developed using Reactjs, together with ChakraUI component library. The backend of our Web Application is hosted on Firebase, using Firebase for authentication and Firestore for the database.

## Challenges we ran into
Our initial idea was to develop a scanner that allows users to scan barcodes of food packaging, adding the expiry date of the food item to a calendar that reminds users when their food items are best used by, expiring or best before. 

And to complement this, we thought of a concept similar to Instagram and Carousell that links users that have food items that have yet to expire but are unable to finish them and users that do not mind consuming these food items. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managed to create a user-authentication system as well as put in place errors such as the Login, Create Account and Forget Password page. 

## What's next for Save Wast-e
With more time, we would want to develop an on-screen map of Singapore displaying all the listings of food items that people want to donate across the island. Perhaps, we could also implement the barcode scanning feature together with the calendar onto our web application as well.
